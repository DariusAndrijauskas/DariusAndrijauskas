<h3>Hi, Iâ€™m @DariusAndrijauskas,</h3>

<p>all my life I was fascinated with computer science and attracted to information technology. It was always a big part of my life, from programming with Pascal way back in high school, to C and SQL in university, even programmed a DSP processor with low level C for my masters thesis project. So in 2021 I am finally making the big leap with both of my feat! Since I'm more of a visual type, I find the frontend web development the most interesting, but at the same time understanding how everything works together is amazing!</p>
